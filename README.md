# React Bricks starter with Next.js using App Router with Tailwind CSS and React Bricks UI

**My React Bricks Portfolio Website**
This is a personal portfolio website I created using **React Bricks**, a tool that lets you build websites with **React** and also edit them visually like a CMS (content management system). I used **Next.js** as the main framework, along with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **TypeScript** for better code quality.

The best part is — I can log into an admin page and edit the website visually, without touching code every time.I deployed it on **Vercel**, which means it’s live and easy to update whenever I make changes to the code or content.

This project helped me learn how to build a professional-looking site from scratch, connect it to a CMS, and publish it online. It also gave me real experience with tools that many companies use in real-world web development.
